## Review Policy for adding content
- Only public github repos are to be added as projects.
- Only the related individual to update their team content.
- All "content" needs to go through an offline gateway (as creating a branch is still public) before pushing work to github.
- When the branch is published, create a pull request with another member of the team as a reviewer to conduct a technical review focussed on the interaction with the website.

**Content Review** (focus on ensuring the content is accurate, appropriate and clear)
- No non-public insights.
- If an opinion/experience piece this needs to be clear at the start.
- Clear reference to other work and contributions?
- Are there any sensitive issues or potential fallout?
- Are any statements likely to reflect badly on the NHS or impact public trust?
- Is the content focussed on the topic?
- Are there other stakeholders that need to be informed or included?
- Are any statements incorrect?
- Are statements backed up with evidence?

**Technical Review** (focus on appearance on the website)
- No data (unless public {in which case reference data rather than copying} or fake/synthetic) or sensitive strings. 
- Working Links?
- Content appearing as expected?
- Content in line with the Digital service manual where possible?
- Is markdown formatting correct?
- Assets added and linked?

**Alternatively**, for small changes such as the addtions listed below, you can ammend the `.yml` and add assets/markdowns directly on github but please do this within a branch and pull request rather than directly on to the main.

## Add Projects

To add/edit projects, simply definie them in `_data/project.yml` and link them to a github repo or io page.  See the kanban.yml in _data for the stage catergories you can assign a project into.

## Add Posts

You can add/edit posts by defining them in `_data/digest.yml` and add the text as a markdown file in the root folder.  Any images need to be stored in assets.
